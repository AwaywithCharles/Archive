# Island Arcadia

Built in Unity 3d for VR Chat.
Created mystery via hidden features by activating game objects.
  - was up to the player to find them, once the first few were found, word of mouth, causing an influx of player wanting to join the world to find more.
  - All objects were coded in C#
  - Interacting with the hidden objects would change and morph the world along with the ambiance in various ways.
      - Lighting was very dark, could enable different tones and colors of lighting
      - light would vary for PC and VR users so made different settings for the users to dial it to how they like.
      - Incorporated hidden mirrors/benches/congregation spots
      - Hidden particle effects and shaders (set to off for performance optimiation on lower end PC's)
      - Able to activate multiple jump puzzles
      - Unlockable hidden flying motorcycle by completing jump puzzles
      - Enforced occlusion culling for performance optimization when on flying motorcycle
      - dabbled in animation to create a flying space whale, made it as part of a jump puzzle
      - able to change mood via different planetary settings through hidden buttons (brighter or darker planets)
      - able to change mood through sound/music playlists
      - world reset button to reset world state back to default in event a glitch is found.
      - Spawnable pillows and player objects
      - Spawnable player seat that is able to be held by other players
